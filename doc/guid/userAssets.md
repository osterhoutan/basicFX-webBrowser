## About
This application allows users to use their own custom assets, for themeing the GUI elements, for loading a custom HTML page (local, over the network, or over the internet) as the newTab page, and finally using a local HTML page as the error page (the page that is loaded when a webpage fails to load).

## The `AppData` Directory:
All user assets should be placed in the `AppData` directory
